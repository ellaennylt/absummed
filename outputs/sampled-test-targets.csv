25806470,"in brief , female atrial fibrillation patients more commonly present comorbidities , leading to a higher prevalence of persistent atrial fibrillation ; moreover , they refer to hospital care later and with a longer disease history .
atrial fibrillation symptoms relate to low quality of life in female patients ; in fact , atrial fibrillation paroxysm usually presents higher heart rate , leading to preferentially adopt a rate rather than a rhythm-control strategy .
female atrial fibrillation patients present an increased risk of stroke , worsened by the lower  oral anticoagulant prescription rate related to the concomitant higher haemorrhagic risk profile .
trans-catheter ablation is under-used in female patients and , on the contrary , they are more commonly affected by anti-arrhythmic drug side effects","Atrial fibrillation is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia .
Its prevalence increases with age and preferentially affects male patients .
Over 75 years of age , however , female patients being more prevalent , the absolute number of patients affected is similar between sexes .
Despite this , few data are available in the literature concerning sex-related differences in atrial fibrillation patients .
The present systematic review therefore considers comorbidities , referring symptoms , quality of life , pharmacological approaches  and  trans-catheter ablation  in female rather than in male atrial fibrillation patients in search of parameters that may have an impact on the treatment outcome ."
23001018,"the various risk stratification schemes classified variable proportions as low , moderate and high risk , but the cha(2)ds(2)-vasc score classified the smallest proportion of patients as ' low risk ' .

25879093,"there is no evidence that dhea  improves quality of life but there is some evidence that it is associated with and rogenic side effects .
there is uncertainty whether dhea decreases menopausal symptoms , but dhea may slightly improve sexual function compared with placebo","BACKGROUND During menopause a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels .
This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms ( for example hot flushes , night sweats , vaginal dryness ) .
Dehydroepi and rosterone ( DHEA ) is one of the main precursors of and rogens , which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens .
It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general wellbeing and sexual function ( for example libido , dyspareunia , satisfaction ) .
Treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety .
This review should clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of r and omised controlled trials .
OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase ."

26377094,"conclusions this systematic review found that most of the evidence associating malaria and malnutrition comes from p. falciparum endemic areas , with a significant heterogeneity in studies ’ design .
apparently malnutrition has not a great impact on malaria morbidity , but could have a negative impact on malaria mortality and severity .
most studies show no association between malaria and subsequent malnutrition in p. falciparum areas .
in plasmodium vivax endemic areas , malaria was associated with malnutrition in children .","Background Multiple studies in various parts of the world have analysed the association of nutritional status on malaria using anthropometric measures , but results differ due to the heterogeneity of the study population , species of the parasite , and other factors involved in the host and parasite relationship .

26679430,"expert opinion results of placebo-controlled trials suggest efficacy and an overall safety profile comparable to existing first-line antidepressants .
the most common side effects are nausea , vomiting and constipation .
results of several studies indicate that vortioxetine may have therapeutic effects on cognition ( e.g. , memory and executive functioning ) that exceed that of st and ard antidepressants .
the authors suggest that vortioxetine is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise , pending additional long-term data , to become a first-line antidepressant option","INTRODUCTION Vortioxetine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) .
This medication is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that also has a number of other potentially relevant effects on serotoninergic receptors , which may differentiate the drug 's effects from those of current first-line antidepressants , such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) .

10796834,"main results for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea there is some evidence of the effectiveness of uterine nerve ablation ( una ) when compared to a control of no treatment .
the comparison between una with presacral neurectomy ( psn ) for primary dysmenorrhoea showed no significant difference in pain relief in the short term , however long term psn was shown to be significantly more effective .
the treatment of una combined with surgical treatment of endometrial implants versus surgical treatment of endometriosis alone showed that the addition of una did not aid pain relief .
for psn combined with endometriosis treatment versus endometriosis treatment alone there was also no overall difference in pain relief , although the data suggests a significant difference in relief of midline abdominal pain .
adverse events were significantly more common for presacral neurectomy , however the majority were complications such as constipation , which may spontaneously improve .
review er 's conclusions there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea , regardless of cause .","BACKGROUND Dysmenorrhoea is the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a very common gynaecological complaint .
Medical therapy for dysmenorrhoea includes oral contraceptive pills ( OCP ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) which both act by suppressing prostagl and in levels .
While these treatments are very successful there is still a 20 - 25 % failure rate and surgery has been an option for cases of dysmenorrhoea that fail to respond to medical therapy .
Uterine nerve ablation ( UNA ) and presacral neurectomy ( PSN ) are two surgical treatments that have become increasingly utilised in recent years .
These procedures both interrupt the majority of the cervical sensory nerve fibres , thus diminishing uterine pain .
Uncontrolled studies have supported the use of these procedures for primary dysmenorrhoea however both operations only partially interrupt some of the cervical sensory nerve fibres in the pelvic area ; therefore dysmenorrhoea associated with additional pelvic pathology may not always benefit from this type of surgery .
OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways as treatment for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea , and to determine the most effective surgical treatment ."
