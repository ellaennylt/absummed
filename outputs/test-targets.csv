31067200,"this indicates that even in the absence of metabolic abnormalities , overweight and obesity are not innocuous , perhaps because the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are either not present early or remain undetected using routine clinical assessment .
this raises the concept that early or sub clinical organ damage assessment s may be better at identifying subjects who are more likely to progress to develop cardiovascular disease .","Obesity and Consequences The prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached epidemic proportion , with the recent figures from the World Health Organization indicating that in 2016 39 % of adults aged ≥18 years ( 39 % of men and 40 % of women ) were overweight and 13 % ( 11 % of men and 15 % of women ) obese .
The World Health Organization states that raised body mass index ( BMI ) is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases ( mainly heart disease and stroke ) , which were the leading causes of death in 2012 , diabetes mellitus , musculoskeletal disorders , and some cancers .
The Framingham Heart Study data have indicated that overweight and obesity are associated with significantly decreased life expectancy .
Nevertheless , and against these strong evidence s , the relationship between BMI and mortality has been challenged by several studies , indicating a survival advantages for those who are overweight and class I obese .
However , the determinants of these observations are poorly understood and continue to be debated because BMI may not be the ideal index of adiposity and fat distribution and fitness and disease prevention may obscure the link between BMI and mortality .
Overweight or obesity is not always accompanied by traditional risk factors .
In fact , a systematic review and meta analysis revealed that about 35 % of obese individuals are metabolically healthy .
There is evidence that an important factor driving at least some of the obesity-associated end-organ damage is overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) , an observation that suggests that targeting SNS in obesity may help reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity .

figure 1 presents an evidence map of studies that evaluated these","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) affects more than 15 million Americans ( 1 ) and is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States ( 2 ) .
Trials have demonstrated reductions in low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels ( 3 ) and decreased ASCVD risk with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) monotherapy ( 4 ) .
Over the past decade , statins have often been used in combination with other lipid-modifying agents .
Recently , several high-profile r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) have evaluated add-on therapy ( 57 ) , wherein statin monotherapy is compared with the combination of the same statin dose and another lipid-modifying agent .
Add-on combination therapy can lead to superior lipid outcomes , but studies have not shown decreased rates of cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , revascularization , or stroke ( 57 ) .
Therefore , the 2013 American College of Cardiology ( ACC ) and American Heart Association ( AHA ) guidelines recommend moderate- or high-intensity statin monotherapy as the first-line strategy for ASCVD risk reduction among patients with LDL cholesterol levels of 4.91 mmol/L or greater ( 190 mg/dL ) , preexisting ASCVD , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , or estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5 % or greater ( 8) .
Adverse effects are more common with higher-intensity statin regimens ( 9 ) , and musculoskeletal adverse events occur frequently among patients with the C variant in the SLCO1B1 gene ( 10 ) .
The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines suggest that clinicians consider moderated combination therapy with a lower-intensity statin and another lipid-modifying medication among high-risk patients ( LDL cholesterol level 4.91 mmol/L [ 190 mg/dL ] , preexisting ASCVD , or DM ) who are intolerant of or unresponsive to statins ( evidence grade E : expert opinion ) ( 8) .
Yet , it is unclear whether this strategy results in similar ASCVD risk reductions and fewer adverse effects compared with higher-intensity statin monotherapy .
A 2009 systematic review that examined these questions found insufficient evidence to weigh benefits and risks of moderated combination therapy ( 12 ) .
We aim ed to compare the effectiveness , safety , and tolerability of moderated combination therapy of statin with another lipid-modifying medication ( bile acid sequestrant , ezetimibe , fibrate , niacin , or -3 fatty acid ) with those of higher-intensity statin monotherapy among high-risk patients .
We sought to compare the long-term clinical benefits and short-term lipid effects of moderated combination therapy with those of higher-intensity statin monotherapy , as well as to determine whether these regimens differ in rates of adherence and harms .
Given the recent release of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines ( 8) , we narrowed the scope of this manuscript to focus on evidence most relevant to high-risk population s for whom combination therapy might be considered .
Prior studies have suggested schemes to group statins on the basis of their reported LDL cholesterol reduction ( 17 , 18 ) , which are similar to the strategy used by the ACC/AHA committee ( 8) ."

26501062,"in the first systematic review , the patients ' or hcps ' overall judgment about the likely evolution of lbp was the factor most strongly linked to poor outcome , with predictive validity similar to that of multidimensional scales .
this result may be explained by the implicit aggregation of many prognostic factors underlying this judgment and suggests the relevance of considering the patients from biopsychosocial and longitudinal points of view .
it is unlikely that any intervention focusing on a single factor would ever fit the needs of most patients ; interventions targeting determinants from several fields ( mainly psychosocial , biomechanical , and occupational ) may be more relevant .
finally , in the third study , the prevalence of psychosocial comorbidity in chronic lbp patients was not found to be significantly higher than in other patients consulting in primary care .
rather than specifically screening for psychosocial conditions , this suggests taking into account any potential comorbidity in patients with chronic lbp , as in other patients .

30293906,"evidence synthesis the most studied combination therapy for the treatment of male luts is the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist/5α-reductase inhibitor combination .
this combination seems to be more efficacious in terms of several outcome variables , in particular in men who have moderate-to-severe luts and are at risk of disease progression .
also in terms of nocturia improvements , this combination is significantly more effective than the monotherapy .
the other often studied combination treatment , in both male and female patients with luts , was the combination of antimuscarinics ( in particular solifenacin ) and mirabegron .
this combination seems to be more effective in comparison with the monotherapies with respect to urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence episodes and several other objective and subjective parameters , without relevant increase of adverse events .

Medical therapy for dysmenorrhoea includes oral contraceptive pills ( OCP ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) which both act by suppressing prostagl and in levels .
While these treatments are very successful there is still a 20 - 25 % failure rate and surgery has been an option for cases of dysmenorrhoea that fail to respond to medical therapy .
Uterine nerve ablation ( UNA ) and presacral neurectomy ( PSN ) are two surgical treatments that have become increasingly utilised in recent years .
These procedures both interrupt the majority of the cervical sensory nerve fibres , thus diminishing uterine pain .
Uncontrolled studies have supported the use of these procedures for primary dysmenorrhoea however both operations only partially interrupt some of the cervical sensory nerve fibres in the pelvic area ; therefore dysmenorrhoea associated with additional pelvic pathology may not always benefit from this type of surgery .

the findings from this review indicate that device diagnostic parameters predict impending hf much earlier than traditional methods of monitoring do .
device diagnostics are also more accurate in the early prediction of hf when compared with noninvasive objective measures , particularly when multiple parameters are combined and monitored for trends .
device diagnostics possess a distinct advantage over traditional methods of monitoring for hf because they allow clinicians to remotely monitor the status of their hf patients without relying on patient compliance for data entry and reporting .
studies regarding the efficacy of device diagnostic parameters suggest that their integration into clinical practice will provide a more accurate and reliable mechanism for assisting clinicians in risk stratifying and predicting potential episodes of decompensated hf","BACKGROUND Traditional methods of heart failure ( HF ) management are based on reactive strategies to treat late indicators of decompensated HF .
Advances in monitoring methods have become available with the evolution of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac-resynchronization therapy devices .
These devices provide new diagnostic data and remote monitoring capabilities that allow clinicians to proactively monitor patients for earlier signs of worsening HF .
The integration of data obtained from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac-resynchronization therapy technology could improve outpatient HF care , potentially leading to decreased readmission rates and improved patient outcomes .

some indication of effect were also observed for programs that conditioned financial incentives on participation in health education and attendance to health care visits .
this finding suggest that the measured effect may be less a consequence of the financial incentive and more due to conditionalities addressing important informational barriers","Background Financial incentives are widely used strategies to alleviate poverty , foster development , and improve health .
Cash transfer programs , microcredit , user fee removal policies and voucher schemes that provide direct or indirect monetary incentives to households have been used for decades in Latin America , Sub-Saharan Africa , and more recently in Southeast Asia .
Until now , no systematic review of the impact of financial incentives on coverage and uptake of health interventions targeting children under 5 years of age has been conducted .

17563549,"results the global antihypertensive activity of arb differs from that observed with amlodipine in the sense that the magnitude of the reduction in the bp values does not essentially depend on the initial bp values nor on the dose used .

limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers ( valproate , carbamazepine ) or antipsychotics ( risperidone , quetiapine , haloperidol ) .
olanzapine may be an exception , as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium .
there is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium .

promising interventions include improvements in the  detection and punishment of corruption  , especially efforts that are coordinated by an independent agency .
other promising interventions include guidelines that prohibit doctors from accepting benefits from the pharmaceutical industry , internal control practice s in community health centres , and increased transparency and accountability for co-payments combined with reduced incentives for informal payments .
key messages the review suggests that some strategies to fight corruption in the health sector can have an effect on corruption .
this study shows that these strategies may have led to fewer patients giving their doctors informal payments ( low certainty evidence ) . •
the study suggests that this may have changed doctors ' attitudes about the influence of pharmaceutical companies on their choice of medicines ( low certainty evidence ) . •

Objectives Our primary objective was to systematic ally summarise empirical evidence of the effects of strategies to reduce corruption in the health sector .
Our secondary objective was to describe the range of strategies that have been tried and to guide future evaluations of promising strategies for which there is insufficient evidence .

Interventions to reduce corruption in the health sector What is the aim of this review ?
The aim of this Cochrane review is to assess the effectiveness of strategies to reduce corruption in the health sector .
Corruption can occur in any area of the health sector , and happens when people abuse their own position to benefit themselves , their organisation , or other people close to them .
It can take many forms , including bribes , theft , or giving incorrect or inaccurate information deliberately .
It can take money away from healthcare , lead to poorer quality care and make access to healthcare unfair , and often affects poor people the hardest ."

the main new finding highlighted by this systematic review is that vitamin d supplementation might help to prevent common upper respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations .
there remains little evidence to suggest that vitamin d supplementation has an effect on most conditions , including chronic inflammation , despite use of increased doses of vitamin d , strengthening the hypothesis that low vitamin d status is a consequence of ill health , rather than its cause .
we further hypothesise that vitamin d supplementation could exert immunomodulatory effects that strengthen resistance to acute infections , which would reduce the risk of death in debilitated individuals .",nan

19581635,"contribution this systematic review found that radiofrequency ablation after a failed drug course maintained sinus rhythm more often than continuation of drug therapy alone .
the benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs appeared to be offset by the serious adverse effects of the drugs .","Context Is radiofrequency catheter ablation a better alternative than medical therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation ?
The Editors Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice ( 1 ) .
Its prevalence increases with age , from 0.1 % in people younger than 55 years to more than 9 % by 80 years of age ( 2 ) .
The heavy burden of atrial fibrillation on morbidity , mortality , and health care re sources creates a pressing need for novel approaches to management .
In some patients , adequate pharmacologic slowing of the ventricular response rate ( a rate-control strategy ) is sufficient to control symptoms .
However , many patients remain symptomatic from the lack of organized atrial contraction and the persistent irregularity of the ventricular response in atrial fibrillation .
In such patients , the appropriate treatment is restoration of normal sinus rhythm , achieved electrically or chemically ( a rhythm-control strategy ) ( 2 ) .
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is a promising approach that offers the benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm without the adverse effects of antiarrhythmic drugs .
Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation is based on the underst and ing that electrical activity emanating from the pulmonary veins frequently serves as a trigger for atrial fibrillation .
In the late 1990s , Hassaguerre and colleagues ( 5 ) observed that elimination of local electrograms at these foci with radiofrequency energy reduced the risk for recurrence of atrial fibrillation .
Currently , the foundation of most atrial fibrillation ablation procedures is to target and electrically isolate the pulmonary veins ( 6 ) .
This may be achieved by delivering lesions immediately outside the ostia of the pulmonary veins or along a wider area in the left atrium encircling the veins .
Additional lesion sets have been used to ablate nonpulmonary vein triggers of atrial fibrillation and to target atrial areas thought to be responsible for maintaining atrial fibrillation ( 6 ) .
These linear lesions may be created in the posterior left atrium , the roof of the left atrium , the interatrial septum , and the isthmus formed between the mitral annulus and the pulmonary vein or left atrial appendage .
At present , the Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation , put forth by the Heart Rhythm Society and endorsed by several professional organizations , states that the foundation of most atrial fibrillation ablation procedures is to target the pulmonary veins , pulmonary vein antra , or both ( 6 ) .
The panel advised us that 8-mmtip and irrigated-tip catheters are now the catheters of choice for radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation in the United States .
The conventional 4-mmtip catheter is rapidly being phased out of use for this indication .
The following 3 key questions were formulated : 1 .
What is the effect of radiofrequency catheter ablation on short-term ( 6 to 12 months ) and long-term ( > 12 months ) rhythm control ; rates of congestive heart failure ; changes in the size of the left atrium and ventricle ; rates of stroke ; quality of life ; avoiding anticoagulation ; and readmissions for paroxysmal , persistent , and long-st and ing persistent ( chronic ) atrial fibrillation ?
2 .
How does the effect of radiofrequency ablation  on rhythm control differ among the various techniques used ?
3 .
What are the short- and long-term complications and harms associated with radiofrequency ablation ?"

26203172,"interestingly , the pure replication shows very similar impacts of the intervention on children in the intervention schools irrespective of whether they took the deworming medicine or not.7 for miguel and colleagues , they term this as ‘ indirect within-school effects ’ of deworming , but equally the effects could be due to the non-specific effects of the health promotion interventions in the intervention schools .
in addition , the study shows that allocation to the deworming group does not influence student progress , as the re- analysis shows clearly no evidence of a difference in examination performance between deworming and control groups.7,8 in the context of the global evidence base , there is only one other study that has examined school attendance with no obvious effect shown.4 given all these uncertainties , we simply do n’t know if there is truly an effect on school attendance from the data , in taking all these factors into account formally in a grade analysis .4 but what weakens the case of deworming still further is that there is now quite good evidence of no effect for most of the main outcomes ( figure 1 ) , including nutritional status , haemoglobin , cognition and school performance .
this is important because without these effects it seems implausible that deworming itself would have an independent effect on school attendance or economic development .","The World Bank , the Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization promote national child deworming programmes in developing countries.1 They assert these programmes will improve nutritional status , health and school performance , and hence contribute to economic growth .

Another trial in India showed benefit , but subsequent trials in the same area failed to show an effect.4,9 So deworming may have helped in these exceptional , heavily infected , untreated population s from another decade , but this is scarcely a solid base for contemporary policy : public health nutrition has changed , worm burden has declined and this probably accounts for the lack of effect on biomedical outcomes in contemporary studies .10 We have been perplexed by the un question ing belief behind deworming in the advocates , and have found it is deep rooted in American history ."

27418186,data from these sources do not support linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet and various adverse metabolic and health-related effects,"Abstract The relationship between sugar consumption and various health-related sequelas is controversial .
Some investigators have argued that excessive sugar consumption is associated with increased risk of obesity , coronary heart disease , diabetes ( T2D ) , metabolic syndrome , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , and stimulation of reward pathways in the brain potentially causing excessive caloric consumption .
These concerns have influenced organizations such as the World Health Organization , the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in Engl and not to exceed 5 % of total energy and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee 2015 to recommend upper limits of sugar consumption not to exceed 10 % of calories .
Data from many r and omized control trials ( RCTs ) do not support linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet and various adverse metabolic and health-related effects .

Rather , people with eating disorders are much more diverse , often undiagnosed and often suffering in silence .
One patient population with a unique but poorly understood vulnerability to eating disorders , as well as obesity and poor physical health , is people with bipolar disorder .
Bipolar disorder is a complex , serious mental illness that confers significant functional impairment , primarily due to time spent in manic , depressed , or mixed state episodes , difficulty eliminating subthreshold depressive symptoms , and the financial , social and emotional sequelae of illness episodes .
One significant contributor to disability is physical ill health , with the average life expectancy of someone with bipolar disorder notably reduced due to cardiometabolic illnesses like heart disease and type two diabetes mellitus .
Furthermore , poorer physical health is associated with poorer mental health in this group , such as higher risk of depressive relapse [ 2 , 3 ] .
The past two decades has seen increased focus on preserving and improving the physical health of people with bipolar disorder , who are often prescribed long-term medication known to be conducive to weight gain [ 4 ] .
Trials of a number of interventions have attempted to implement lifestyle interventions to promote healthy eating , physical activity , and social connectedness , in order to prevent or reduce the adverse impact of obesity and improve physical health and psycho-social functioning [ 5 ] .
The role of disordered eating in contributing to physical and mental health outcomes among individuals with bipolar disorder has rarely been considered , despite the fact that approximately one in three people with bipolar disorder also meet criteria for binge eating disorder , bulimia nervosa , or variants of these disorders [ 7 , 8 ] .
Alongside studies question ing the impact of medication on weight gain in bipolar disorder [ 9 ] , identifying the role of weight-cycling in higher cardiovascular risk [ 10 ] , and showing that obesity risk pre- date s medication [ 11 ] , are reports of a link between eating disorders and high Body Mass Index ( BMI , kg/m ) [ 12 ] and evidence that baseline binge eating predicts medication-associated weight gain [ 13 ] .
With these recent developments in mind , the authors were curious about what novel interventions for eating disorders and weight disorder in bipolar disorder exist , and conducted a systematic review about their effectiveness .
In this search no treatments targeting eating disorders specifically were found to exist [ 14 ] , despite the movement of this area into the spotlight over 10 years ago [ 15 ] ."

Both breast milk and infant formulas contain carnitine .

18347346,some have suggested that growth hormone is a wonder drug ( 16 ) that results in ripped muscle ( 17 ) and provides stamina-increasing properties ( 18 ) .,"The use of human growth hormone to improve athletic performance has recently received worldwide attention .
This practice , often called sports doping , is banned by most professional sports leagues and associations , including the International Olympic Committee , Major League Baseball , and the National Football League ( 13 ) .
However , a wide range of athletes , including those from baseball ( 46 ) , cycling ( 7 , 8) , and track and field ( 5 , 9 ) , have been implicated in or have confessed to illicit growth hormone use .
The Mitchell report ( 10 ) recently identified 89 Major League Baseball players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs , and some of these players have subsequently admitted to using growth hormone ( 11 , 12 ) .
Part of the attraction of using growth hormone as a performance enhancer has been that its use is difficult to detect .
The World Anti-Doping Agency , whose formation stemmed from the widely publicized doping sc and al of the 1998 Tour de France ( 13 ) , first used a blood test to detect exogenous growth hormone during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens .
Although growth hormone is reportedly used to enhance athletic performance and has been called the most anabolic substance known ( 15 ) , its efficacy for this purpose is not well established .
Exogenous growth hormone therapy in growth hormonedeficient adults ( that is , those with growth hormone deficiency due to hypothalamic or pituitary defects ) results in increased lean mass and decreased fat mass ( 19 ) , and comparable body composition changes are seen in healthy elderly adults who receive growth hormone ( 20 ) .
Some experts , however , have suggested that the strength-enhancing properties of growth hormone among healthy adults have been exaggerated ( 15 ) .
Serious side effects , including diabetes , hepatitis , and acute renal failure , may occur in athletes using high-dose growth hormone ( 21 ) .
Furthermore , the use of growth hormone for athletic enhancement is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and the distribution of growth hormone for this purpose is illegal in the United States ( 22 ) .
We performed a systematic review of r and omized , controlled trials to determine the effects of growth hormone therapy on athletic performance in healthy , physically fit , young adults .

findings in this study suggest that computer navigation or robotic assistance may help managing these multiple variables and could improve outcomes .","Recently , there is a growing interest in surgical variables that are intraoperatively controlled by orthopaedic surgeons , including lower leg alignment , component positioning and soft tissues balancing .

The largely untapped potential of the health care payment system to change physician and health care system behavior has stimulated interest in both the scientific literature ( 2 , 3 ) and the popular press ( 4 - 6 ) for linking payments to performance on quality measures .
Several health plans ( 3 , 7 ) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are using explicit financial incentives for quality ( 8 , 9 ) .
For example , what types of clinical conditions or health care services should be the target of financial incentives to improve quality : chronic diseases , acute care , or preventive care services ?
How effective ( and cost-effective ) are financial incentives for quality ?
What are the optimum magnitude , frequency , and duration of financial incentives for quality ?
What is the optimum package of nonfinancial interventions ( if any ) to include with financial incentives for quality , for example , audit and feedback , recognition , clinical reminders , academic detailing , or information technology support ( 12 , 13 ) ?
Can we expect the effect of financial incentives to persist after they are stopped ?
Because any effective intervention will have some unanticipated effects , will important patient care activities that are not rewarded financially be neglected ?
The purpose of this paper is to assess the relationship between explicit financial incentives and the provision of high- quality health care by systematic ally review ing empirical studies .
Because the evidence regarding the relationship between the financial incentives embedded in fee-for-service and capitation arrangements and the quality of health care has been thoroughly review ed in previous work ( 14 ) , we focused our review on literature that addresses explicit financial rewards for improving health care quality .
Methods Study Identification and Selection We conducted a systematic search of the English- language literature in PubMed to find articles published between 1 January 1980 and 14 November 2005 whose main objective was to assess the use of explicit financial incentives to improve health care quality .
Access to care is the patient 's attainment of timely and appropriate health care .
Structure of care is a feature of a health care organization or clinician relevant to the provision of health care .
Process of care is a health care service provided to or on behalf of a patient .
Outcome of care is a health state of a patient result ing from health care .
Concurrent comparison groups are important because some studies of quality may show dramatic improvement over time but no statistically significant differences between intervention and comparison groups ."

in addition , we focused our critique on generalization of treatment effects across setting s and time and on sample diversity ( with regard to ethnicity and levels of parent education ) in relation to the population .
children of parents with higher levels of education than average appear to be overrepresented in the literature .","The purpose of this research was to up date the series of articles on evidence -based treatment for children and adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder that have appeared in this journal ( Evans , Owens & Bunford , 2014 ; Pelham & Fabiano , 2008 ; Pelham , Wheeler , & Chronis , 1998 ) ."
20149117,"the authors even suggested in this case increasing educational levels as a means of reducing obesity .
indeed , we have recently reported results from two experimental studies showing that mental work up-regulates appetite-stimulating hormones and promotes overconsumption of food ( 3,4 ) .
furthermore , a careful examination of our data revealed that when the subjects were categorized on the basis of the mental workload intensity , those for whom the intensity of the mental effort was greater significantly increased their spontaneous food intake as compared with those characterized by a less strenuous cognitive effort .
in other words , the harder we think the more we eat .
this hyperphagic effect of intense thinking was also accompanied by more plasma glucose instabilities ( 5 ) .
the fluctuations in plasma glucose levels that were observed are in agreement with the literature showing that a period of intense cognitive processing leads to a measurable decrease in levels of blood glucose ( 6 ) , a fall that has also been associated with feeling less energetic ( 7 ) .
accordingly , food intake might be perceived as a strategy for allowing the individual to recover optimal body functioning .
these observations are also relevant for students having hard times to learn at school and for whom study ing is arduous and mentally challenging .
on the basis of our observations , we find it realistic to postulate that those susceptible to commit more cognitive effort to take in charge st and ard mental tasks are more likely to over-eat and gain weight compared with those for whom the accomplishment of mental tasks at the same level of performance is elementary or more natural .
along the same lines , it would not be surprising to find a higher dropout rate for those ‘ mentally stressed ’ students .
in a system where academic performance continues to rank as high priority in public schools , it seems obvious that some students are genetically more gifted and likely to perform at a higher level ( 8) .
as previously shown , better cognitive abilities are predictive of more important life achievements such as earning a doctorate , securing a patent , or publishing a novel or major literary work ( 9 ) .
it may be somewhat paradoxical that the amount of knowledge-based work is more important in the higher socioeconomic groups whereas population data show a higher prevalence of obesity for the socioeconomically disadvantaged .
thus , individuals highly involved in mental work are not all likely to over-eat and other healthy behaviours such as regular physical activity may counterbalance the net impact on energy balance .
as mentioned in the paper by yu and co-workers ( 1 ) , educational attainment seems to be an important mediator of this relationship .","In an early view issue of this journal , Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) published a systematic review and meta- analysis about the mutual relationship between obesity and intelligence quotient ( IQ ) .
The authors observed that a lower IQ score in childhood was associated with obesity in later adulthood .
Although it is not possible to definitively rule out reverse causation in the IQ – obesity relationship , two main mechanisms have been put forward by the authors that could explain why a low IQ has been found to be a predictor of obesity .
First , higher intelligence may reduce the risk of obesity by promoting more healthful behaviours .
For example , data from a cohort study showed that children with higher mental ability scores reported significantly more frequent consumption of fruit and vegetables and more high-intensity physical activity participation in adulthood ( 2 ) .
Second , higher childhood IQ may predict favourable socioeconomic positions later in life .
With the advent of computers and new technologies , the pendulum has swung far in the direction of excessive mental activities , as opposed to excessive physical activities .
A careful examination of computer-related activities reveals that they represent a particular type of sedentary activities ; they are stressful and biologically dem and ing for the body and deserve to be counterbalanced by an adequate physical activity regimen ( 10 ) ."

these models are not suitable for all patients and require the identification and education of suitable c and i date s. potential advantages of poc devices include improved convenience to patients , better treatment compliance and satisfaction , more frequent monitoring and fewer thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications .
potential disadvantages of the device include the tendency to underestimate high inr values and overestimate low inr values , low thromboplastin sensitivity , inability to calculate a mean normal pt , and errors in inr determination in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies with certain instruments .
although treatment satisfaction and quality of life ( qol ) may improve with poc inr monitoring , some patients may experience increased anxiety or preoccupation with their disease with these strategies .
the majority of studies reported favourable impacts of poc inr monitoring on qol and found better treatment satisfaction with poc monitoring .","UNLABELLED SUBJECT OF THE EVIDENCE -BASED ANALYSIS : The purpose of this evidence based analysis report is to examine the safety and effectiveness of point-of-care ( POC ) international normalized ratio ( INR ) monitoring devices for patients on long-term oral anticoagulation therapy ( OAT ) .
CLINICAL NEED TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Long-term OAT is typically required by patients with mechanical heart valves , chronic atrial fibrillation , venous thromboembolism , myocardial infa rct ion , stroke , and /or peripheral arterial occlusion .
It is estimated that approximately 1 % of the population receives anticoagulation treatment and , by applying this value to Ontario , there are an estimated 132,000 patients on OAT in the province , a figure that is expected to increase with the aging population .
Patients on OAT  are regularly monitored and their medications adjusted to ensure that their INR scores remain in the therapeutic range .
This can be challenging due to the narrow therapeutic window of warfarin and variation in individual responses .
Optimal INR scores depend on the underlying indication for treatment and patient level characteristics , but for most patients the therapeutic range is an INR score of between 2.0 and 3.0 .
There is currently no population -based Ontario data to permit the assessment of patient care , but recent systematic review s have estimated that less that 50 % of patients receive OAT on a routine basis and that patients are in the therapeutic range only 64 % of the time .
OVERVIEW OF POC INR DEVICES POC INR devices offer an alternative to laboratory-based testing and venipuncture , enabling INR determination from a fingerstick sample of whole blood .
Independent evaluations have shown POC devices to have an acceptable level of precision .
They permit INR results to be determined immediately , allowing for more rapid medication adjustments .
POC devices can be used in a variety of setting s including physician offices , ACCs , long-term care facilities , pharmacies , or by the patients themselves through self-testing ( PST ) or self-management ( PSM ) techniques .
With PST , patients measure their INR values and then contact their physician for instructions on dose adjustment , whereas with PSM , patients adjust the medication themselves based on pre-set algorithms .
EffectivenessDoes POC INR monitoring improve clinical outcomes in various setting s compared to st and ard laboratory-based testing?Does POC INR monitoring impact patient satisfaction , QoL , compliance , acceptability , convenience compared to st and ard laboratory-based INR determination ?
Cost-effectivenessWhat is the cost-effectiveness of POC INR monitoring devices in various setting s compared to st and ard laboratory-based INR determination ?
